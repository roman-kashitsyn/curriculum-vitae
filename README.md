My CV in LaTeX format. I used CurVe package as basis.

How to Build
------------

You need latex implementation (TexLive will succeed) with latest
versions of `curve` and `filehook` packages installed (`filehook.sty`
can be placed to `~/texmf/tex` directory).

You are also have to install [SCons](http://www.scons.org) tool.

When you have all the requirements installed, just run `scons`
command in the project directory.
