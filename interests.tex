\text{
  I have two major areas of interest: software architecture and
  functional programming. I am reading books on architecture and
  recognizing architecture solutions and patterns in existing
  projects. I also like to learn and apply in practice functional
  programming languages like Clojure (and other Lisp dialects), Scala,
  Erlang and (a little bit) Haskell.
